# Distributed Computing in Java 9
This is the code repository for [Distributed Computing in Java 9](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/distributed-computing-java-9?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787126992), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Go to MapDistributed computing is the concept with which a bigger computation process is accomplished by splitting it into multiple smaller logical activities and performed by diverse systems, resulting in maximized performance in lower infrastructure investment. This book will teach you how to improve the performance of traditional applications through the usage of parallelism and optimized resource utilization in Java 9.

After a brief introduction to the fundamentals of distributed and parallel computing, the book moves on to explain different ways of communicating with remote systems/objects in a distributed architecture. You will learn about asynchronous messaging with enterprise integration and related patterns, and how to handle large amount of data using HPC and implement distributed computing for databases. 

Moving on, it explains how to deploy distributed applications on different cloud platforms and self-contained application development. You will also learn about big data technologies and understand how they contribute to distributed computing. The book concludes with the detailed coverage of testing, debugging, troubleshooting, and security aspects of distributed applications so the programs you build are robust, efficient, and secure.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
[default]

public static void main(String[] args) {
 
  System.out.println(“Distributed computing with Java 9”);       
}
```

To follow along with this book, you’ll need a computer with an internet connection. You can choose to work online on the Cloud Java IDE to practice the examples. I recommend you have the Eclipse IDE with Tomcat/WebLogic container with the respective jars based on the concept you want to practice happily. For concepts such as cloud computing, you should have access to Cloud Foundry to practice.
